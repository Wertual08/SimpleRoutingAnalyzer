# SimpleRoutingAnalyzer
Simple utility for graphical representation of 
routing algorithms and some metrics calculations.
It supports several basic algorithms and graph topologies.
Program provide graphical interface for editing generated
graphs. Also, there is a tool for testing and analysing 
algorithms in the unstable environment where random nodes 
are disabled.
